# Controllers

This folder contains the controllers for the application. Controllers handle incoming requests, process them, and return the appropriate response. They act as the intermediary between the models (data) and the views (user interface - UI).

## What to Add:
- Controllers should contain logic related to handling HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- Organize the controllers by feature, module, or resource (e.g., `userController.js`, `authController.js`).
- Each controller should include error handling and interact with the corresponding services and models.

## Example Structure:
- `userController.js`: Handles user-related routes (e.g., login, registration).
- `challengeController.js`: Manages challenge-related actions (e.g., fetching challenge details, adding challenges).
  
Ensure that all controllers are well-documented and follow proper coding conventions.
